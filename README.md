# Google Book Search App

Google Books Search

In this activity, I will be creating a new React-based Google Books Search app. I created React components. I worked with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query to display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
